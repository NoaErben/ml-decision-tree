# ML Project Decision Tree Classifier from Scratch

This project was developed as part of the **"Machine Learning from Data"** course. It implements a decision tree classifier from scratch and includes optional pruning based on the Chi-square statistical test to prevent overfitting.

## 📁 Files

- `hw2.ipynb`: A Jupyter notebook with step-by-step instructions, visualizations, and sanity checks.
- `ml-decision-tree.py`: A standalone Python module implementing the core logic for the decision tree, including tree construction, entropy calculations, and pruning with a Chi-square threshold.

## 🚀 Features

- Recursive decision tree construction using information gain
- Entropy-based splitting criteria
- Support for multi-way splits
- Chi-square pruning for early stopping
- Clean and modular implementation using NumPy and standard Python data structures
- Queue-based BFS printing for visualization

## 🧪 Example Capabilities

- Binary classification with categorical or discretized features
- Visualization of decision tree structure
- Performance evaluation pre/post pruning


## 📝 Notes

This assignment emphasizes interpretability and hands-on algorithm implementation. It follows a bottom-up development style, with each function contributing to a fully functional decision tree pipeline.
